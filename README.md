# CustomCodex Prompt Builder

This repository provides a system for crafting thoughtful prompts for Codex. It is intended for humans who want to express their intentions clearly when interacting with a Codex instance.

The files and directories here contain guidelines, components, and examples that help you construct prompts from reusable pieces. Use them as scaffolding to build your own instructions rather than as final answers.

Each file focuses on a different aspect of prompt design:
- **COMPONENTS.md** – modular prompt pieces such as instructions, constraints, and context snippets.
- **REFLECT.md** – heuristics and questions to review a prompt before using it.
- **SENSES.md** – catalog of different prompt intentions and how they shape structure and tone.
- **EXAMPLES.md** – sample prompts annotated with their sense and composition.
- **SCAFFOLDS/** – optional templates or flows for building prompts step by step.

This project does not produce ready‑made prompts. Instead, it helps you clarify the purpose and sense of your own prompts so that your interactions with Codex can be more deliberate.
