# Prompt Reflection

Use these heuristics to evaluate a draft prompt before sending it to Codex.

1. **Sense Check** – What is the underlying intent? Is it truth-seeking, exploratory, instructive, or system-shaping?
2. **Clarity** – Are instructions specific or do they leave room for confusion?
3. **Tone** – Does the language reflect the desired stance? (e.g. formal, conversational, neutral)
4. **Scope** – Is the request too broad or too narrow? Can it be broken into smaller steps?
5. **Ambiguity** – Are there terms that might be interpreted differently by the system?
6. **Constraints** – Have you clearly spelled out any limits or required formats?
7. **Readiness** – Does the prompt feel honest and ripe, or would waiting help it settle?

Reflect on these points, revise the prompt as needed, and then append your final custom instruction before you send it.
