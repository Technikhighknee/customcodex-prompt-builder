# Prompt Senses

This catalog describes common intentions behind prompts and how they affect structure and tone.

## System-Shaping
A prompt that configures or steers Codex itself. These often include explicit behavioral instructions and constraints. They tend to be assertive and direct.

## Truth-Seeking
A prompt aimed at factual accuracy or clarifying information. It benefits from clear questions, context, and source expectations.

## Dialogic
Prompts that invite conversation or exchange. They typically use open questions or statements encouraging multiple perspectives.

## Open-Ended
Prompts for exploration or brainstorming. These emphasize possibility, may minimize constraints, and often ask Codex to imagine or reflect.
