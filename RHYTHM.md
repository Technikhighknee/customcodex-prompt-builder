# Prompt Rhythm

Prompts do not always arrive fully formed. Sometimes they need room to breathe before they can be expressed clearly. This file offers a perspective on the life cycle of a prompt.

1. **Seed** – A vague question or impulse begins to take shape.
2. **Hold** – Allow the idea to rest. Notice what remains unsaid or uncertain.
3. **Ripen** – As clarity grows, refine the language and intent.
4. **Speak** – When the prompt feels honest and ready, share it with Codex.

Pausing between these stages can reveal hidden motives or better phrasing. Trust the rhythm of this process when composing your prompts.
